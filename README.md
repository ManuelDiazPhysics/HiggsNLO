Development code for a tool that could offer e^+e^- optimization focusing on EW corrections and Higgs observables with full NLO EW automation. It could also speed up the precision by specializing phase-space integration for ZH at 240â€“250 GeV. Finally, it can provide an easier interface for BSM physics fitting the experimental data.

-Objectives: 
1. Compute NLO electroweak corrections for e^+e^- to ZH at future e^+e^ colliders to achieve sub-1% theoretical precision.  
2. Develop a dedicated software tool optimized for Higgsstrahlung, improving automation and accuracy over general-purpose frameworks.  
3. Confront theory with future projections to constrain Higgs couplings and probe BSM physics.
